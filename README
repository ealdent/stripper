= Stripper

Stripper is a plugin that removes leading and trailing blanks from attribute
values.

Leading and trailing spaces on attribute values can be a problem. They're almost never
wanted nor intended. In fact, oracle actually treats empty strings as +NULL+. That's
not to say we necessarily think that the database should be messing with our data mind
you but it does show that at least someone agrees with us.
